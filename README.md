# ImageSorter
ImageSorter is a two part program. Firstly it train on given dataset and create an encoding model of a face and then runs the algorithm to scan all the images in a given file structure and cross reference the trained model to separate out those images with more that 60% match with almost 100% accuracy (depending upon the dataset provided)
