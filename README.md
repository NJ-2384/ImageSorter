# ImageSorter
ImageSorter is a two-part program:
- Firstly it trains on given dataset and generates an encoding model of a face.
- Then we run the algorithm to scan all the images in a given file structure and cross-reference the trained model to separate those images with more than 60% match with almost about 99.58% accuracy
